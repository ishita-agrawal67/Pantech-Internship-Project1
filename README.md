# CodeAlpha_Task
This project aims to develop a robust image recognition system capable of accurately identifying objects within images. Our goal is to harness the power of machine learning 
and computer vision to create an intelligent model that can recognize and classify various objects with high precision.

## Project Overview
The Image Recognition involves building a convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform image classification. The dataset used for training and testing the model is the 
popular CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Normalization and augmentation techniques to improve model performance.
- **Model Architecture**: A well-defined CNN model with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Comprehensive training process with validation and evaluation metrics to assess model accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing training progress, loss, and accuracy, as well as the confusion matrix for detailed performance analysis.
